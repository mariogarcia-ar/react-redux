Sure, here's how you can set up a project using React, Redux, Redux Toolkit, and RTK Query with Vite:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
   - Create a new Vite project with React: `npm create vite@latest my-app`
   - Navigate into the project directory: `cd my-app`
   - Install Redux and Redux Toolkit: `npm install redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux`
   - RTK Query is included in Redux Toolkit, so no separate installation is needed.

2. Set up your Redux store:
   - Create a new file called `store.js` in the `src` directory and import `configureStore` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`.
   - Define your initial state and reducers using the `createSlice` function from `@reduxjs/toolkit`.
   - Use `configureStore` to create your Redux store and export it.

3. Create your React components:
   - In your `App.jsx` file, import `useSelector` and `useDispatch` from `react-redux`.
   - Use the `useSelector` hook to access the Redux store state and the `useDispatch` hook to dispatch actions.
   - Build your React components and connect them to the Redux store using the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks.

4. Use Redux Toolkit to simplify your Redux code:
   - Instead of manually defining action types and action creators, use the `createSlice` function from `@reduxjs/toolkit` to generate them automatically.
   - Use the `createAsyncThunk` function to handle asynchronous actions.
   - Use the `createEntityAdapter` function to simplify managing normalized data.

5. Integrate RTK Query for data fetching:
   - Import `createApi` and `fetchBaseQuery` from `@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react` and define your API endpoints.
   - Use the `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks to fetch and mutate data from your API.
   - Configure the `api` property in your Redux store to include your API endpoints.

6. Start your Vite app:
   - Run `npm run dev` to start your Vite app and see it in the browser.

Remember to import the necessary modules and components in your files, and follow the documentation for each library to learn more about their specific features and usage.
